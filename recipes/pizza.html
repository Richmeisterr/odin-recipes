    <h2>Cheesy Crust Pizza</h2>
    <p>
        If you refrain from grain, but can't go without pizza...you've got to try this version with a 1-ingredient crust made just from cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Â½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>4 small fresh mozzarella balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot skillet; cook until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
            <li>Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the melted cheese, leaving space for a "crust" to form; cook until top is bubbling and edges are browned, 2 to 3 minutes. </li>
            <li> Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice pizza onto a cutting board; cool for 1 minute before slicing. </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
